* TODO Welcome to the world of unicorns, goblins
In this world unicorns only tell the truth.
Goblins only lie.
A says: B is a unicorn.
B says: A and I are opposite type.

What is A: A Goblin

What is B: A Goblin

* TODO 8 duds and 1 armed bomb.
Some idiot forgot to disarm a bomb that is laid in the 'decomisioned' bomb pile.
Unfortunately the only way to tell which bomb is armed is to use a special weighing system.
To add insult to injury we don't know if the armed bomb weighs less or more on the system just that it weighs differently.
But there is yet another catch the weighing system only have two charges left, but it can weight any number of bombs at once.
Your job is to tell which 1 bomb out of the 9 bombs is armed while only using the weighing machine twice.

Assuming that the bomb is heavier: weight two sets of three on the scale. take the three that weighted heavier or the three not wieghted if they weigh the same. then weigh the two bombs of the taken set: the bomb is the heavier one or the one not weighted if they weigh the same. 

Assuming the bomb is lighter: repeat above but replace 'Heavier' with 'lighter'.

* TODO The BEAST
The Shoe Shack has made several top-dollar sales today. 
Using only the clues below, match each customer to their foot size, 
shoe brand and final purchase price.

No option in any category will ever be used more than once.  

1. The $185 pair was 4 sizes smaller than Natalie's pair.
2. The Cormano footwear was somewhat smaller than the Williford footwear.
3. The Schtillet footwear was somewhat larger than Marie's pair.
4. The $125 pair was somewhat larger than Marie's pair.
5. Lucia's pair wasn't made by Tinghill.
6. Of the $185 pair and the size 9 set, one was bought by Francine and the other was by Graffetz.
7. The $245 pair wasn't made by Tinghill.
8. The $260 pair was 2 sizes larger than Vanessa's pair.
9. The Williford footwear was 1 size smaller than Francine's pair.
10. The $125 pair was 2 sizes smaller than Ruth's pair.
11. The $215 pair was 5 sizes smaller than the $170 pair.
12. The $185 pair was 2 sizes smaller than Lucia's pair.
13. The Schtillet footwear was either Ruth's pair or the size 5 set.
14. The Abbott Hill footwear was 5 sizes larger than the $215 pair.
15. The Williford footwear was 1 size smaller than the $245 pair.

* TODO Exercises
In 01-ponder do every third exercise. 
That is if you start at the first or 1st then you need to do 4th,
but if you start at 3rd then you need to do the 6th.

You must put them in this file!

* UCA
Start your Excercise warmup by thinking up examples and three non-examples of propositions. Make them pithy.

| Examples:    | Dogs are mammals | I am a Human  | Math is logical    |
| Non-examples | Tuesday          | cats are dogs | when is your lunch |

* OGR 
  Which of the following are simple (not compound) propositions?

  1. Weeks are shorter than months.
  2. Days are longer than hours and minutes.
  3. Hours are longer than minutes and seconds are shorter than minutes.
  4. People can fly or pigs can sing.

1 and 4 are both simple (not compound) propositions.

  Use truth tables to verify some miscellaneous laws, letting $\mathbf{1}$ =
  true, $\mathbf{0}$ = false:
  1. $p \land \mathbf{1} \equiv p$ (idempotence)
  2. $p \lor \mathbf{0} \equiv p$ (idempotence)
  3. $\lnot \lnot p \equiv p$ (double negation)
  4. $p \land \mathbf{0} \equiv \mathbf{0}$ (absorption)
